  - Parameter configuration with validation
  - Real-time command preview
  - Copy/Execute/Save functionality
  - Pre-built templates for common tasks

- **Textarea Component** (`frontend/src/components/ui/textarea.tsx`)
  - Added missing UI component for multi-line input

### 4. Enhanced Navigation
- **Updated App Routing** (`frontend/src/App.tsx`)
  - Added routes for Extensions and Command Builder pages

- **Enhanced Home Dashboard** (`frontend/src/pages/HomeDashboard.tsx`)
  - Added navigation cards for new features
  - Improved grid layout for better organization
  - Clear feature descriptions

### 5. API Integration
- **Enhanced API Layer** (`frontend/src/lib/api.ts`)
  - Added server management commands to API abstraction
  - Proper error handling and type safety

- **Web API Extensions** (`frontend/src/lib/webApi.ts`)
  - Added server management endpoints for web mode
  - Consistent API interface across platforms

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

### Component Organization
- Created dedicated directories for feature-specific components:
  - `components/servers/` - Server management components
  - `components/tools/` - Tool browsing components

### Type Safety
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for all new components
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Type-safe API calls

### User Experience
- Loading states and disabled controls during operations
- Clear visual feedback for server status
- Intuitive navigation between features
- Search and filtering across all browsing interfaces
